        Despite the cancellation of trick-or-treating, I am here today to bring you the last nominee for Candy Awards 2020.
    Chocolate. The most sentimental yet fundamental treat, chocolate can be enjoyed at any time of the day, whether it
    is in the morning or after supper. Many argue that chocolate should not be categorized as candy, but I will be
    talking about that in a later blog post. Today, I will walk you through everything you will need to know about 
    chocolate.

        If you havenâ€™t tried chocolate before, it is a preparation of cacao beans. It is first fermented, then dried, cleaned,
    and roasted. Chocolate can come in various forms and shapes, whether it is a bar, baked goods, or even a drink. There 
    are many types of chocolate, such as white chocolate, dark chocolate, and milk chocolate. Personally, I favour white
    chocolate over the other types, mostly because I find it sweeter.

        Chocolate dates back to as early as 1900 BC. It was made primarily as a drink combined with multiple spices. The first 
    edible chocolate bar was created in 1847, by J.S Fry & Sons, a candy company. Nowadays, chocolate can be found everywhere, 
    and it is widely used at parties, celebrations, and weddings. 

        If you ever plan on buying chocolate, I recommend that you buy the ones from Cadbury. They are cheap, sweet, and they 
    encourage responsible farming.
