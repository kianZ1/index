    Lately, I’ve been browsing the net and gathering information to nominate the next candy candidate for <i>Candy Awards 2020</i>.
I was stuck debating between multiple candies and I couldn’t think of what to write. While I was surfing the web, I got 
an advertisement for the perfect candy nominee: cotton candy. Silky and made of pure sugar and air, cotton candy is one
of my favourite things to enjoy in the summer.

    If you haven’t tried cotton candy before, it is a combination of sugar and air spun to resemble a cloud. Cotton candy is
sold on sticks, but it can also be packaged into containers and sold at retail stores. My favourite place to buy cotton 
candy is at carnivals or amusement parks and I rarely buy any outside of summer, mostly because it is hard to find it.

    The St. Louis World Fair first introduced cotton candy in 1904. It was sold in little boxes, which could be bought for 25 cents. 
The most common cotton candy colors are pink and blue. The creators of cotton candy are Dr. Morrison and John C. Wharton.
Cotton candy is also known as candy floss or fairy floss.

    Cotton candy is a blessing, but be extremely careful when handling it. Never touch the candy or else it will melt and 
stick to your hands, and never lick it or expose it to any liquids. Cotton candy melts immediately whenever it comes into
contact with anything warm or wet, so only hold it by the stick or container. These habits will save you from a sticky 
mess. You can thank me after you’ve enjoyed your candy.
